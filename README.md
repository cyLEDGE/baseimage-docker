# cyLEDGE Base Image

Base image to be used as source (Dockerfile:FROM) for other images.
It is based on the well tested [Phusion Baseimage](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/).
Applause for the phusion guys!

## RTFM

Please dive into the nature of this image by reading the [README of phusion/base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/blob/567a53db24b1b5e47c7aa41a8444011cd4bb99cd/README.md)
